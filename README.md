# Workshops application

This is entry application for Ruby on Rails Workshops held by Netguru.

### Changes to base files:

Reason for changing the original files is compatibility issues with environment I work in.
Environment is: Windows 7 x64, Ruby 2.1.5p273, Rails 4.1.8

1. Change of 'pg' gem to pre-release 0.18 . Default version (0.17) showed errors with pg.ext file.  [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27321017/active-support-dependencies-rb247-require-cannot-load-such-file-2-1-pg-ex)
2. Add 'tzinfo-data' gem. This solves time zone errors related to database. [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23022258/tzinfodatasourcenotfound-error-starting-rails-v4-1-0-server-on-windows)
3. Configure PostgreSQL through pgAdmin III. Add new Group Roles as 'workshops'. In properties checked 'login', 'superuser', 'create roles'. Other fields left as default.
4. Configure pg_hba.conf to log into database. Change 'method' from 'md5' to 'trust'. [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2942485/psql-fatal-ident-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres)
5. Add extra options to database.yml. Port and timeout options were specified. [Source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7689097/ruby-on-rails-how-can-i-edit-database-yml-for-postgresql)
6. Change version of Devise. Previous version blocked performing db:migrate.
7. Add bcrypt gem. This gem is required for encrypting passwords.

### Issues solved:

5. Fix specs for `Category` model.

6. Fix specs for `Review` model.

11. In navigation bar insert links for guest users to login / signup and for users that are already logged in - to logout.

1. There are a few missing fields on the `User` model. Make sure `spec/models/user_spec.rb passes.`

3. Check `spec/controllers/categories_controller_spec.rb` - there should be a
   couple errors on actions checking admin presence.

### Issues to solve:

2. Make sure settings for [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) are
   configured properly.  If they arenâ€™t, most of the controller specs will fail:
  * Most of the configuration changes require the server to be restarted.
  * At some point **you'll have to overwrite the default devise views** - you can find all the required info in the gem readme.

4. Next up: `Product` model and `spec/models/product_spec.rb`. Play with validations a bit, calculate average rating and you'll be good to go.

7. You'll have to deal with `ProductsController`. Again, you'll have to check for permissions. Only a product owner should be able to make changes. Make sure to give the user a proper message when they try to perform forbidden actions.

8. Make sure `ReviewDecorator` is used properly, There's one action which needs to be declared there. See `spec/decorators/review_decorator_spec.rb` for details.

9. Check if each review is assigned to user who wrote it.

10. If some actions (like links to edit a page, create a new one) are not allowed for a particular user then please hide them in a template (for example with `if`).

12. Don't forget to check if application works in the browser :).

13. Unleash your design skills. Add some CSS to the application to make it prettier (we won't say it's ugly, but you know, it's not a beauty [YET!]). Please use [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) for styling, which is already added to application. Psss! Don't forget about styling `devise` views :).

14. Create user profile page (using Boostrap 3). Use your imagination about what should go there. You can start with name, email, etc.

15. On user profile list 5 last user's reviews with formated date (dd-mm-yy).

16. Fill `seeds.rb` with 5 accounts for user and one admin account to login and example category with products and reviews.

17. Make sure your project is available on Heroku with **seeds data**.

## Requirements for qualification of application
